# GeneralStoreMVC

Project completed at Eleven Fifty Academy. General Store is a Model-View-Controller with 3 tables (Customer, Product, and Transaction) each with full CRUD operations.

The database for the store was initially seeded with the use of an SQL Script. Then the code was scaffolded using the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore Nuget package.

Very little custom styling was done as the point of this project was to learn and understand MVCs.
